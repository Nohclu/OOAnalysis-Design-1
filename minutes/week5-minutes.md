## Minutes:

- We are now satisfied with our use case descriptions.
- We need to draw out a least one Use Case Diagram of our choosing.
- We are using the Game Over scenario as our Use Case Diagram as we feel it is the simplest one to draw out.
- The structured walkthrough is now up for discussion.
- Jake feels that our scenarios can help us out with this.
- The structured walkthrough was completed with little to no disruption.
- We are happy with our walkthrough, now turning to compiling everything for the week 5 deadline.
