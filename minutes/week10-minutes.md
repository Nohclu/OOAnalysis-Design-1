- Connor volunteered to take minutes.
- Goals for the meeting is to get sockets and flask server working and flush out board class.
- Jake and James researched flask/socketio and quickly implemented it into our server class.
- Proceeded onto board class.
- Rather than everyone coding we decided to do joint programming (reduce syntax errors and ensure valid logic).
- Refactored board class.
- Implemented core functions.
- During implementation bugs arose but core logic is implemented.
- Discussed and whiteboarded potential fixes and approaches for next meeting.
