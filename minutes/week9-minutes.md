# Week 9 OO Analysys & Design Projects Minutes

__Week:__ 9 __Start Date:__ 2018/11/21 __Present:__ __Excused: Absent: Remote:__ Connor, Jake, James, Michael and Martynas 

## Minutes:
- Connor selected to write minutes.
- Decided to do a remote meeting due to busy schedule.
- Continuation of yesterdays work (implementing more of the classes logic).
- We decided to postpone coding and focus on implementation because of the reason stated yesterday in regards to the class diagrams.
- Each member went through what they have done, the thought process behind it and what they had left to do. This helped clear up any confusion people had.
- As people went through their code, indescrepencies were found and issues were posted to github in regards to them.
    - Bag being a dictionary rather than a list.
    - The swap method was to be removed from bag and placed elsewhere.
    - Letter id's were redundant.
    - Square coordinates were also redundant since they will be placed into a matrix.
    - Square isMiddle() implementation was not sound (pushed back as it was not game breaking)
