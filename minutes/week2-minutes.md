## Minutes:
- James was selected to write the minutes.
- Team view of game written out by Connor in advance of meeting.
- We are working on a word game similar to Scrabble.
- We ran through the rules of the game so everyone had a cear understanding of scrabble.
- This game will be played online between two players or more.
- The problem statement was written by Jake .
- Our base level requirements can be found in our problem statement.
- Along with this, we decided we wanted the game to be played by no less than 2 players, and no more than 4 players.
- Refined requirements include:
    - A default board size of 15 squares by 15 squares.
    - A default rack size of 7 tiles.
    - The number of tiles in a default game of scrabble is 100.
- We discussed the idea of users being able to change the board size and rack size when setting up a game.
- We discussed the idea of the number of tiles in a game being proportionally linked to the board size.
- We found that these ideas would be better served as an set of additional functions we could implement after we meet our requirements.
- Refined requirements written out by Jake
